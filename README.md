# ASCend
> **A minimal story about inter-dimensional rifts and what to do about them...**

My first attempt at an interactive fiction story, built with Twine/Twee3, Tweego and GSAP.

Inspired by the likes of A Dark Room, Howling Dogs, Zork, and Stone Story RPG.


## v.1.0 - Demo - Introduction & Day 1/3
Completed as part of a university course, I familiarised myself with the Twine SugarCube story format and integrated GSAP animations and pixel art.
So far, this is a proof of concept for getting features up and working - plus testing out the 'ASCII rune' input minigame.
